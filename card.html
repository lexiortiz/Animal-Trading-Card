        <p>Emperor penguins are large flightless birds found south of the equator. They survive in Antarctica by being adaptable and swimming to feed their families. When a female penguin is courted and lays an egg, she immediately leaves the egg with a male penguin, who warms and protects the egg for 65 days until the female returns with food.</p>
